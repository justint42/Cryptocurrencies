# Cryptocurrencies

Accountability Accounting, a prominent faux investment back, wishes to offer dcryptocurrency investment portfolios for its customers. The user is tasted in creating a report to include what cryptocurrencies are on the trading market and how they could be grouped to create a classification system for this new investment. To do this, the gathered data is processed to fit machine learning models. Using unsupervised machine learning, we grouped the cryptocurrencies using a clustering algorithm. Finally, we visualized our findings to share with the board of directors.
